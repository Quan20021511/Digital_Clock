## Features

- **Accurate Timekeeping:** The clock circuit utilizes the IC 4060 as a stable time base oscillator, ensuring precise timekeeping.

- **LED Display:** The current time is displayed on a 7-segment LED display, making it easy to read from a distance.

- **Simple Controls:** The clock features straightforward control buttons for setting and adjusting the time.

- **Low Power Consumption:** The design optimizes power usage, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.

## Components Used

- IC 4060: A 14-stage binary ripple counter and oscillator that generates clock signals.
- IC 4013: A dual D-type flip-flop for clock signal division and control.
- 7-Segment LED Display: To display the hours and minutes.
- Crystal Oscillator: Provides accurate timekeeping.
- Push Buttons: For setting and adjusting the time.

## Usage

1. Connect the clock to a power source.
2. Use the control buttons to set the current time.
3. The clock will display the time continuously with high accuracy.
